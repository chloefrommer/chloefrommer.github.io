An ethnographer is someone trained to observe the world, or worlds, meaningfully, through the practice, participation, and co-production of realities - therefore a co-creative. The theory behind the ethnographic method is primarily anthropological - based in the studies of human diversity and evolution. Whereas the performance of ethnographic methods can be situated in numerous academic and non-academic contexts including film.

Through video and film, my ethnographic work is also visual, sensorial, critical, performative, and design oriented. But when I had first cut my teeth on ethnographic methods, I started out like many others with anthropologist Clifford Geertz's interpretive approach. That is, it's “turtles all the way down”. Understanding others' life worlds in being, in perceiving, in doing and in becoming through multiple, overlapping contexts and domains of practice and performance is key (verstehen). To understand, the meaning and valence must be excavated from human made sense, worlds, things and/or realities. Such layers or worlds - can be thought of as we might turtles or, as in Indian Country (my emerging focus) Turtle Island(s), because they are vitally animated by human and non-human natures. As worlds are ontological actualities - made by what we know - I begin research typically then by foregrounding the differences between what we know (matters of fact) before seeking how these ways of knowing link to what we sense, do, make or become. And from there, how the knowledge is thereafter shared across different representational platforms, material culture or physical natures. As sui generis worlds materialize contingent upon how we value what is known - matters of ethical concern are also realized. 

My first ethnographic research with traditional healers in Zimbabwe revealed ethics-in-formation through the cosmological practice of accessing, keeping, sharing, performing and valuing traditional medicinal knowledge.  And inasmuch as the cosmological framework operating this circulation of knowledge, materia medica, and ritual meaning was based in the idea that healing arts are a gift from ancestors - the typical trade-related intellectual property rights that alienate sacred possessions were shown to not apply.  Though there are boundaries between expert, specialist, trade and other kinds of indigenous knowledge, what is clear is that among family or equals - a property regime would freeze the cultural practices of sharing, innovating, and reproducing knowledge. 

With our information economy today then it has actually become harder to trust, share, and collaborate to produce truly original stories. It is for this reason especially though that I have moved from research to film.

While Coppola rightly points out that "the director of a film the ringmaster of a circus inventing itself”, no film would happen without the members of the circus - human, non-human actors and the choreography of action, context, and relation that magnifies the inter-subjective dramas even in our own lives as we are making the film. In the openness of film processes made through collaboration especially - there is potential for both profound grounding of subjectivities well as profound speculations about alternative futures. In most cases in my work, this latter feature means taking back the story - especially those master / disciplinary narratives, genres, or theories that subjugate the affects, forces, or pluripotentiality of actual life.

The potentiality of life - human and non-human - then is my contemplation / exploration / collaboration work that I house under Otherwise Productions. Through ethnography, film, design and speculative fiction writing - this company always strives to read lack otherwise.
