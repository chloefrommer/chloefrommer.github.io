An ethnographer is someone trained to observe the world, or worlds, meaningfully, through the practice, participation, and co-production of realities - therefore a co-creative. The theory behind the ethnographic method is solely anthropological - based in the studies of human diversity and evolution - whereas the performance of ethnographic methods can be situated in numerous academic and non-academic contexts. One of the reasons why I extend my ethnographic research into filmmaking collaborations and products. 

Through video and film, my ethnographic work is also visual, sensorial, critical, performative, and design oriented. But when I just cut my teeth on ethnographic methods, I also said like anthropologist Clifford Geertz that what we are looking at something that may be theorized to be “turtles all the way down”: indicating that interpretation (verstehen) is key. Meaning and valence is uncovered through multiple, overlapping layers of worlds, things and/or realities. Such layers or worlds - can be thought of as we might turtles or, as in Indian Country (my emerging focus) Turtle Island(s), because they are vitally animated by human and non-human natures. As worlds are ontological actualities - made by what we know - I begin by foregrounding the differences between what we know (matters of fact) before getting to how ways of knowing, sensing, doing or becoming may be shared across different representaional platforms (as matters of ethical concern). When I triangulate from a physical reality to practices of making or enacting elements in tha reality to actual positions whereby humans take the historical and actual formations to be meaningful - I often encounter the cosmopolitics by which non-human life is also taken as matters of concern, especially where they may be sacred, rights-bearing entities

The versatility by which the matters of any worlds’ in-formation are accessed, kept, shared, or valued can be studied in the field of cultural economy, such that trade-related intellectual property rights are granted for novel, derivative forms of knowledge, whereas older forms must be either valued as an indigenous intellectual property right, indigenous knowledge, or an intangible hertage. My first ethnographic research with traditional healers in Zimbabwe revealed, this inasmuch as these older dimensions of the present knowledge economy and cultural industries can be actively re-discovered through co-creative research processes - especially film. 

As Coppola is right says the director of a film the “ringmaster of a circus inventing itself”, it is for me too a choreographry of actors, things, places in response to both past real events as well as potential alternative futures. The enactment of worlds through collaborative research and exploratory subjectivities for a film can be both profoundly grounding as well as profoundly speculative about alternative futures - most often taking back the stories so often told of victimization, powerlessness, or injustice. By adding speculative, anticipatory, or forward thinking aproaches to documentary - I either produce docu-drama, or dramatize the potentials or positionalties implicit with any given scenario. Support for this innovative approach comes from feminist materialists, quantium physicists, and design ethnographers. 

I now contemplate such otherwise futures through a combination of speculative ethnography, film, and design fiction - under the umbrella of my boutique research, film, and advocacy company - Otherwise Productions.
